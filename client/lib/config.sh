    # This code with $LAST_PRESAVED_COMMAND and $LAST_SAVED_COMMAND is necessary to work around a quirk of
    # bash. With bash, if you run the command `foo` and then press `Control+R`, it will trigger the DEBUG
    # signal. And `history 1` will still return `foo` so this will lead to duplicate pre-saves causing entries
    # to show up twice. This works around this issue by skipping presaving if the last commadn we presaved
    # was identical. 
    # 
    # This does lead to a potential correctness bug since it means if someone runs the same non-terminating
    # command twice in a row, we won't pre-save the second entry. But this seems reasonably unlikely
    # such that it is worth accepting this issue to mitigate the duplicate entries observed in
    # https://github.com/ddworken/hishtory/issues/215.
